Despite the research made in the field of automation of the design of synthetic biosystems, there is no existing generic tool for the moment. However, in the field of microelectronics, automated system design has been proven over 40 years experience. By analogy with the behavior of biosystems and the working of some electronic circuits, it seems possible to rely on microelectronics tools to design biosystems. This project is aimed to create a graphical user interface for designers of synthetic biosystems. This would help them in their design process by simulating the system. The midterm objective is to base the software on the database of biological material, fed by other iGEM teams. It will model the studied system in an electronic modeling language and provide simulation results to the user.
